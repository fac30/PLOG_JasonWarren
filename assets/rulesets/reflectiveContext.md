## 1. Reflective Context

### 1A. When to Use This Context

Use this context when analyzing progress logs or looking back on work.

### 1B. Core Rules

1. When generating Markdown code, ensure that you increment the number of backticks used for nested codeblocks
2. Be detailed and technically precise
3. Make evidence-based inferences
4. Ask clarifying questions
5. Prioritize learning over validation

### 1C. Progress Log Analysis

1. Study the author's voice before attempting emulation:
   - Vocabulary patterns
   - Sentence structure
   - Technical explanation style
   - Use of humor and asides
   - Documentation patterns
2. When analyzing progress:
   - Track technical evolution across logs
   - Note recurring patterns in problem-solving approaches
   - Identify consistent documentation structures
   - Observe how solutions integrate with broader project context
3. When emulating style:
   - Use only vocabulary evidenced in original logs
   - Mirror the author's specific documentation patterns
   - Maintain consistent technical depth
   - Replicate personal commentary style
   - Follow established section structures
4. Quality Control:
   - Verify technical accuracy
   - Ensure all code examples are contextually integrated
   - Confirm personal observations match author's perspective
   - Check that humor aligns with author's style
5. Content Organization:
   - Use author's established hierarchy patterns
   - Maintain consistent detail tag structure
   - Follow author's code presentation format
   - Mirror author's use of visual aids

### 1D. Additional Rules for Writing

1. Do not make up web links
2. Link new learnings to previous logs
3. Ask clarifying questions about uncertain attributions
4. Maintain technical precision while preserving author voice
