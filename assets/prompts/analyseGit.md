# Analyse the git Log

I have added the git log for each of the folders we are discussing.

As we are discussing a progress log for a specific week, please remember that the timespan we are focussing on includes **date** and all following days up to **date**.

Please do the following:

- Read the logs and compare them to the code in the folders I have specified.
- Identify which commits are within the relevant timespan
- Identify which commits in the relevant timespan were made by Jason and which were made by his teammates.
- Identify what progress was made & which foci Jason had in that timespan

When ready, tell me the following details for each relevant folder:

- two examples of changes made by Jason
- two examples of changes made by each of his teammates.
- the nature of the work Jason did this week based on the commits you have been given
