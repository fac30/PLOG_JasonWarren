## 4. AI Review

Each week, after writing the log, I give my IDE's AI the following prompt:

```md
@Web @Codebase 
Compare the this log to the previous week's log.

Write an evaluation of the author's progress in the time between these logs. Observe the following rules:

- Do not repeat or rephrase observations made by the author, instead choosing to make new evidence-based inferences
- Prioritise your sources as follows, with source 1 being more important than source 2 etc.:
  1. Jason's Progress Logs
  2. Jason's files that contain relevant code
  3. Information & context obtained from the web
```

Here's its response:
