### Jason

#### Things I Did (By Category)

##### Reminded Me Why I Got Kicked Out of 3 Schools

- [X] 

##### `const jason = { engagement: 0, stimulated: false }`

- [X] Set up continuous deployment on Netlify.
- [X] Did tutorials. So many tutorials (GitHub actions, JSDocs)

##### Intellectually Stimulating

- [ ] Anything. At. All.

#### Questions I Have

- If I deploy my frontend, but most of the content is pulled from an undeployed backend, how do I know whether I've correctly deployed my frontend?
- For a small team like us, is there literally any benefit at all ever to using AWS or is it all a cruel joke?
